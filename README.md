# Practical-opencv-project-finding-coordinates-of-detected-objects-and-knn-digit-recognition
In this project i will show you how you can find circles, their coordinates in an image plus recognize digits on those circles using knn and finally arrange the recognized digits in ascending order of their value and click on those circles sequencially with the help of coordinates associated with the numbers.
